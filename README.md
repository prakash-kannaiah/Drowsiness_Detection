# Drowsiness Detection

![Project Thumbnail](Image/Tumbnail.png)

This project implements a drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib. The system detects the drowsiness of a driver by monitoring their eye aspect ratio (EAR) and displays a warning message on the screen when drowsiness is detected.

## Features

- Real-time drowsiness detection using a webcam.
- Uses Dlib's pre-trained facial landmark predictor.
- Calculates the eye aspect ratio to detect drowsiness.
- Displays warning messages on the screen when drowsiness is detected.

## Code Explanation

For a detailed explanation of the code, see [Code Explanation](Code_Explanation.md)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- Scipy
- Time

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/prakash-kannaiah/Drowsiness_Detection.git
    cd drowsiness-detection
    ```

2. Create and activate a new Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the facial landmark predictor model and place it in the `shape` directory:

    - [shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)

5. Extract the `.bz2` file:

    On **Windows**:
    - **Using 7-Zip**:
      1. Right-click the `.bz2` file in File Explorer.
      2. Select `7-Zip` > `Extract to "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat\"`.

    - **Using WinRAR**:
      1. Right-click the `.bz2` file in File Explorer.
      2. Select `Extract Here` or `Extract to "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat\"`.

    Alternatively, you can use the following command in a command prompt if you have `bzip2` installed:
    ```bash
    bzip2 -d shape/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
    ```
    **This will extract the file directly into the `shape` folder as `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`.**

    If you donâ€™t have `bzip2` installed, you can download it from the [GnuWin32 project](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bzip2.htm) or use the GUI tools mentioned above.
